# Spense Landing Page

Spense is a landing page for writers. A great Codewell challenge for practicing absolute positioning and flex layouts.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Clone it and have fun

Clone this project running `git clone https://github.com/cicerorfonseca/spence-landing-page.git`, and then run:

```
npm start
```

It will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### A bit more about the work in progress

I could have used plain HTML/CSS/JS to build this project, although, I opted to use React to kick this project off because I intend to implement all the other routes not available in the designs.

I also choose to use SASS specially to nest styles and creating mixins for buttons and shared styling.

I used `normalize.css` from Nicolas Gallagher - github.com/necolas/normalize.css - to add CSS resets and normalize styles browser wide.
